# Numerical integration

## Simpson's rule

Simpson's rules are the methods of numerical integration proposed by Thomas Simpson. There are two kind of rules given by Thomas Simpson, called Simpson's 1/3 rule and Simpson's 3/8 rule. Both these rules provide more accurate approximations compared to the Trapezoidal Rule by using parabolic or cubic interpolations instead of linear ones.

### Simpson's 1/3 Rule

Consider two consecutive subintervals, $[x_{i-1}, x_i] \text{ and } [x_i, x_{i+1}]$
