# Regression and Curve Fitting


### Polynomial curve fitting
Concept of Polynomial curve fitting is similar to linear curve fitting. A straight might not be the ideal representative of the data under consideration. Then some polynomial curve might be a good choice,

The polynomial has the form, 
```math
f(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + ... + a_nx^n
```
If a set of data containing m points is to be fitted by the polynomial curve of degree n, a system of linear equations is formulated to compute values of the coefficients
```math
[A]\{a\} = \{B\}
```
Where, A is a matrix and a and B are vectors.
