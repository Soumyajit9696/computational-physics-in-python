# System of Linear Equations

A **Linear Equation** is an inequality of the form 

```math

\sum_{i=1}^n a_ix_i = y,
```

where, $a_i$ are scalars, and $x_i$ are unknown variables in Real space, and y is a scalar.

A **system of linear equations** is a set of linear equations that share the same variables. consider the following system of equations;
```math 
a_{1,1}x_1 + a_{1,2}x_2 +  a_{1,3}x_3 + ... + a_{1,n-1}x_{n-1} + a_{1,n}x_n  = y_1
```
```math
a_{2,1}x_1 + a_{2,2}x_2 +  a_{3,3}x_3 + ... + a_{2,n-1}x_{n-1} + a_{2,n}x_n  = y_1
```
