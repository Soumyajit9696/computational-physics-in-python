#Root Finding

## Bisection Method
**Algorithm of Bisection Method**
1. Input two values of x that embrace the interval where the root is expected
2. Calculate corresponding values for y
3. Check for the sign difference between y-values.
4. If the signs are not opposite, stop
5. Calculate the value of x in the half of the interval
6. Check for the sign difference between the y-values first half interval 
7. If the signs are opposite, let x1 and x2 be the limits of the first half interval
8. Else let x1 and x2 be the limits of the second half interval
9. If values of y approaches zero, print the x-value and stop
10. Else repeat steps from 5 to 10.
